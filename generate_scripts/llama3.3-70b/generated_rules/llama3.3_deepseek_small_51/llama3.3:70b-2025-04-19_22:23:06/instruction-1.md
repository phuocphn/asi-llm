### Step 1: Identify MOSFET Transistors
Identify all MOSFET transistors in the SPICE netlist by looking for lines that start with 'm' and have a model type of either 'pmos' or 'nmos'.

### Step 2: Determine Drain and Source Connections
For each MOSFET transistor, determine its drain and source connections. In a current mirror, the drains of two or more transistors are connected together.

### Step 3: Find Common Gate Connections
Identify groups of MOSFET transistors that have their gates connected to the same node. This is a characteristic of current mirrors, where multiple transistors share the same gate voltage.

### Step 4: Check for Shared Drain or Source Connections
Within each group of transistors with common gate connections, check if any of them also share a drain or source connection. If they do, it could indicate a current mirror configuration.

### Step 5: Verify Current Mirror Configuration
To confirm the presence of a current mirror, verify that:
- The transistors in question are either all 'pmos' or all 'nmos'.
- They have a common gate connection.
- At least two of them share a drain or source connection.
- The shared connection is not to ground or supply unless it's part of a larger current mirror structure involving multiple transistor types.

### Step 6: Group Current Mirror Transistors
Group the transistors that meet the criteria for a current mirror. Each group represents a single current mirror circuit within the SPICE netlist.

### Step 7: Compile List of Current Mirrors
Compile a list of all identified current mirrors, where each current mirror is represented by the names of its constituent MOSFET transistors.

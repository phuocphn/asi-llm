### Step 1: Identify MOSFET Transistors
Identify all MOSFET transistors in the SPICE netlist by looking for lines that start with 'm' followed by a unique identifier (e.g., m1, m2, etc.).

### Step 2: Determine Drain and Source Connections
For each MOSFET transistor identified, determine its drain and source connections. In a current mirror configuration, the drains of two or more transistors are typically connected to the same node.

### Step 3: Identify Shared Gate Connections
Identify groups of MOSFET transistors that share the same gate connection. Current mirrors often have multiple transistors with their gates connected together.

### Step 4: Check for Matching Transistor Types
Verify that the transistors within each group identified in Step 3 are of the same type (either all PMOS or all NMOS). This is a characteristic feature of current mirrors, as they typically consist of multiple identical transistors.

### Step 5: Analyze Drain Current Paths
For each group of transistors identified, analyze the paths through which their drain currents flow. In a current mirror, one transistor's drain current is mirrored to another transistor's drain.

### Step 6: Identify Biasing and Supply Connections
Identify how the gates of the transistors in each group are biased and how they are connected to supply voltages. Current mirrors often have specific biasing configurations that allow them to operate correctly.

### Step 7: Group Transistors into Current Mirrors
Based on the analysis from Steps 1 through 6, group the MOSFET transistors into sets that form current mirrors. Each set should consist of transistors with shared gate connections, matching types, and drain currents that are mirrored.

### Step 8: Verify Current Mirror Configurations
Verify that each group identified as a current mirror has a configuration consistent with known current mirror topologies (e.g., simple current mirror, cascode current mirror, etc.).

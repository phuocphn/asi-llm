### Step 1: Identify MOSFETs with Shared Gates
Identify all MOSFETs in the SPICE netlist that share the same gate connection. This is a key characteristic of current mirrors, as they typically consist of multiple transistors with their gates tied together.

### Step 2: Determine Drain and Source Connections
For each group of MOSFETs identified in Step 1, examine their drain and source connections. In a current mirror, one transistor's drain is usually connected to the supply voltage or another node that sets the current, while the other transistors have their drains connected to nodes where the mirrored current will flow.

### Step 3: Check for Matching Transistor Types
Verify that the MOSFETs within each group are of the same type (either all PMOS or all NMOS). Current mirrors typically consist of transistors of the same type to ensure proper current mirroring.

### Step 4: Identify Supply and Ground Connections
Identify how the sources of the MOSFETs in each group are connected. In a current mirror, the sources are usually connected either to the supply voltage (for PMOS) or to ground (for NMOS), which helps in identifying the direction of current flow.

### Step 5: Analyze Gate Voltage and Current Flow
Analyze how the gate voltage is controlled for each group of MOSFETs. In a current mirror, the gate voltage of one transistor sets the current, which is then mirrored by the other transistors. Look for connections that suggest this type of current control.

### Step 6: Group Transistors into Current Mirrors
Based on the analysis from Steps 1 through 5, group the MOSFETs into potential current mirrors. Each group should have transistors with shared gates, matching types, appropriate supply or ground connections, and a configuration that suggests current mirroring.

### Step 7: Verify Current Mirror Functionality
For each identified group, verify that the circuit functions as a current mirror by checking if the current flowing through one transistor is mirrored in the other transistors. This can involve analyzing the netlist for connections that would allow current to be set by one transistor and then replicated by others.

### Step 8: Compile List of Current Mirrors
Compile a list of all identified current mirrors, noting the specific MOSFETs involved in each mirror. This list represents all instances of current mirrors found within the SPICE netlist.

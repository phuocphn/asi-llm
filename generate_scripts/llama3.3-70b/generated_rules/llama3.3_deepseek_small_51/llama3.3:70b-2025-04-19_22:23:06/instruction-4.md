### Step 1: Identify MOSFETs with Shared Gates
Identify all MOSFETs in the SPICE netlist that share the same gate connection. This can be done by parsing the netlist and grouping MOSFETs based on their gate node.

### Step 2: Determine Drain and Source Connections
For each group of MOSFETs with shared gates, determine the drain and source connections of each transistor. This will help in identifying potential current mirror configurations.

### Step 3: Check for Matching Drain and Source Connections
Check if the drain and source connections of the MOSFETs within each group are matched, indicating a potential current mirror configuration. A current mirror typically consists of two or more transistors with matched drain and source connections.

### Step 4: Verify Current Mirror Configuration
Verify that the matched MOSFETs form a valid current mirror configuration by checking for the following:
- The gates of the MOSFETs are connected to the same node.
- The drains of the MOSFETs are connected to separate nodes, indicating that they are sinking or sourcing current.
- The sources of the MOSFETs are connected to the same node or to a common voltage source (e.g., ground or supply).

### Step 5: Identify Current Mirror Groups
Group the MOSFETs that form valid current mirror configurations. Each group represents a single current mirror.

### Step 6: Output Current Mirrors
Output the identified current mirrors, listing the MOSFETs that comprise each mirror.

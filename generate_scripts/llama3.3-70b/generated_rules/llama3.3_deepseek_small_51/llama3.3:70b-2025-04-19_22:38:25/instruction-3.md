### Step 1: Identify All Transistors in the Netlist
List all transistor elements (e.g., `m1`, `m2`, etc.) present in the SPICE netlist.

### Step 2: Determine the Gate Connections of Each Transistor
For each transistor identified, note the node connected to its gate.

### Step 3: Identify Common Gate Connections
Group transistors that share the same gate connection. These groups are potential candidates for differential pairs.

### Step 4: Analyze Drain and Source Connections for Symmetry
Within each group of transistors sharing a gate connection, examine the drain and source connections to identify symmetry. A differential pair typically consists of two transistors with symmetric drain and source connections relative to their common gate connection.

### Step 5: Check for Current Mirror or Differential Amplifier Configuration
Verify if the identified symmetric transistors are part of a current mirror or differential amplifier configuration by checking their connections to other components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, power supplies).

### Step 6: Confirm the Presence of a Differential Pair
If the transistors are connected in a manner consistent with a differential pair (i.e., they form part of a differential amplifier or are symmetrically configured), confirm that these transistors indeed represent a differential pair.

### Step 7: Compile the List of Differential Pairs
After analyzing all groups and confirming the presence of differential pairs, compile a list of transistor names that constitute each differential pair found in the netlist.

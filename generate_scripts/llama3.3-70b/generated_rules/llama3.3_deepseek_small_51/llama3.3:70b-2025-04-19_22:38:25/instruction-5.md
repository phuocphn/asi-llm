### Step 1: Identify Transistors with Common Gate Terminals
Identify all transistors in the SPICE netlist that share a common gate terminal. This can be done by parsing the netlist and grouping transistors based on their gate connections.

### Step 2: Filter Transistors Based on Type and Configuration
Filter the identified transistors to only include those that are of the same type (e.g., both PMOS or both NMOS) and have a similar configuration (e.g., both with their sources connected to the same node).

### Step 3: Check for Differential Pair Characteristics
For each pair of filtered transistors, check if they exhibit characteristics of a differential pair. This includes:
* Having their gates connected to different input nodes (e.g., `in1` and `in2`)
* Having their drains connected to the same output node or a common internal node
* Being part of a larger circuit that amplifies the difference between the two input signals

### Step 4: Verify Differential Pair Operation
Verify that the identified transistors operate as a differential pair by checking the surrounding circuitry. This includes:
* Checking for current mirrors or other circuits that provide a common current source for both transistors
* Verifying that the output of the differential pair is taken from the drains of the transistors or from a node that is driven by the differential pair

### Step 5: Record Identified Differential Pairs
Record the names of the transistors that form each identified differential pair. These transistor names can be used to extract the corresponding circuit elements and analyze their behavior in more detail.

### Step 1: Extract Transistor Information
Extract all transistor (m*) elements from the SPICE netlist, including their node connections.

### Step 2: Identify Potential Differential Pairs and Their Connections
For each pair of transistors, check if they share the same current mirror or load transistor and have different input nodes. Note the nodes connected to their gates, drains, and sources. Also, determine the drain and source connections of each transistor as these will be crucial for identifying differential pairs.

### Step 3: Determine Gate and Drain/Source Connections
Verify that pairs of transistors either share the same gate connection node or have complementary drain/source connections (e.g., one connected to `in1` and the other to `in2`, or similar). Look for pairs where one transistor's drain is connected to another transistor's source (or vice versa), indicating a potential current mirror or differential amplifier configuration.

### Step 4: Analyze Symmetry and Configuration
Within each group of potential differential pairs, examine the drain and source connections to identify symmetry. A differential pair typically consists of two transistors with symmetric drain and source connections relative to their common gate connection. Check for common gate connections among the matched pairs, which is indicative of a differential pair.

### Step 5: Verify Differential Pair Characteristics
For each potential pair, verify that their configurations match the characteristics of a differential pair:
- Both transistors are of the same type.
- Their gates are connected to different input nodes or they share a gate connection but have distinct drain/source connections.
- Their sources are connected to a common node or to each other through another transistor.
- Their drains are connected to different output nodes or to a common output node through other transistors.

### Step 6: Check for Current Mirror or Differential Amplifier Configuration and Symmetrical Loads
Verify if the identified symmetric transistors are part of a current mirror or differential amplifier configuration by checking their connections to other components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, power supplies). Also, check if there are corresponding load transistors (usually PMOS) that are connected symmetrically, typically connected to VDD.

### Step 7: Confirm the Differential Pair Configuration and Compile the List
Confirm that each identified pair consists of two input transistors with a common gate connection, each having its drain connected to a load transistor, and these load transistors are typically connected to VDD. After applying the above steps, compile a list of all identified differential pairs in the netlist, including the names of the transistors involved.

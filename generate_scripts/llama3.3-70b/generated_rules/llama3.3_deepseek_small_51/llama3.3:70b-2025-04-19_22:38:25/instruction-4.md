### Step 1: Identify All Transistors in the Netlist
List all transistor elements (e.g., `m1`, `m2`, etc.) present in the SPICE netlist.

### Step 2: Determine the Drain and Source Connections of Each Transistor
For each transistor identified, note its drain and source connections as these will be crucial for identifying differential pairs.

### Step 3: Identify Matching Drain-Source Pairs
Look for pairs of transistors where one transistor's drain is connected to another transistor's source (or vice versa), indicating a potential current mirror or differential amplifier configuration.

### Step 4: Check for Common Gate Connections
Among the matched pairs from Step 3, identify those that share a common gate connection. This is indicative of a differential pair since in a differential amplifier, two transistors typically share the same gate voltage to compare two input signals.

### Step 5: Verify the Presence of Symmetrical Load Transistors
For each potential differential pair identified, check if there are corresponding load transistors (usually PMOS) that are connected symmetrically. These loads should be connected to the drains of the differential pair transistors and to a common voltage supply (VDD).

### Step 6: Confirm the Differential Pair Configuration
A confirmed differential pair consists of two input transistors with a common gate connection, each having its drain connected to a load transistor, and these load transistors are typically connected to VDD. Ensure that the configuration matches this description.

### Step 7: Compile the List of Identified Differential Pairs
After applying the above steps, compile a list of all identified differential pairs in the netlist. Each pair should include the names of the transistors involved (both the input differential transistors and their corresponding load transistors).

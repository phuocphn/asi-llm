### Step 1: Identify All MOSFETs in the Netlist
Identify all MOSFET instances (e.g., `m1`, `m2`, etc.) in the given SPICE netlist.

### Step 2: Determine the Gate Connections of Each MOSFET
For each identified MOSFET, determine the node connected to its gate.

### Step 3: Identify Common Gate Connections
Identify pairs of MOSFETs that share a common gate connection but have different drain or source connections.

### Step 4: Check for Complementary Drain/Source Connections
Within the pairs identified in Step 3, verify if one MOSFET has its drain/source connected to a node labeled as `in1` and the other to a node labeled as `in2`, or any similar complementary input nodes.

### Step 5: Confirm Differential Pair
Confirm that the pair of MOSFETs meeting the criteria in Steps 3 and 4 indeed form a differential pair by ensuring they are part of a larger circuit structure typical for differential amplifiers, such as having their sources connected to current mirrors or other biasing circuits.

### Step 6: Compile List of Differential Pairs
Compile a list of all identified differential pairs based on the analysis from the previous steps.

### Step 1: Extract Transistor Information
Extract all transistor (m*) elements from the SPICE netlist, including their node connections.

### Step 2: Identify Potential Differential Pairs
For each pair of transistors, check if they share the same current mirror or load transistor and have different input nodes.

### Step 3: Check for Matching Current Mirrors or Loads
Verify that the two transistors in question are connected to the same current mirror or load transistor by checking their drain and source connections.

### Step 4: Verify Different Input Nodes
Confirm that the two transistors have different input nodes (gate connections) to ensure they can operate as a differential pair.

### Step 5: Check for Complementary Transistors
If one transistor is a PMOS and the other is an NMOS, or vice versa, it could indicate a complementary structure often used in differential pairs.

### Step 6: Analyze Surrounding Circuitry
Examine the surrounding circuit elements (resistors, capacitors, other transistors) to ensure they do not disrupt the differential operation of the pair.

### Step 7: Identify Differential Pair
If all conditions are met, identify the transistor pair as a **Differential Pair**.

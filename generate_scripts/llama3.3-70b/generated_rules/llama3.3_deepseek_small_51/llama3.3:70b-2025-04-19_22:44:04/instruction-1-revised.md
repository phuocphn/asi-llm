### Step 1: Identify MOSFETs in the Netlist
Identify all MOSFETs (both PMOS and NMOS) in the given SPICE netlist by looking for lines that start with 'm' followed by a unique identifier, or contain "pmos" or "nmos" in their description.

### Step 2: Determine Drain, Source, and Gate Connections
For each identified MOSFET, determine its drain, source, and gate connections. Inverters typically involve MOSFETs where one terminal is connected to the input or output of the inverter, and the other terminal is connected to either the supply voltage (VDD) or ground.

### Step 3: Look for Complementary MOSFET Pairs
Inverters are composed of complementary MOSFET pairs (one PMOS and one NMOS). Identify pairs where:
- The gates of both MOSFETs are connected to the same node (input of the inverter).
- One MOSFET's source is connected to VDD (PMOS), and the other's source is connected to ground (NMOS).
- Both MOSFETs' drains are connected to the same node (output of the inverter).

### Step 4: Verify Inverter Structure
For each potential pair identified, verify that they form an inverter structure by checking:
- The PMOS transistor has its source connected to VDD.
- The NMOS transistor has its source connected to ground.
- Both transistors' gates are connected to the input of the inverter, and their drains are connected to the output.

### Step 5: Compile List of Inverters
Compile a list of all identified inverters based on the complementary MOSFET pairs that satisfy the conditions outlined above. Each inverter is represented by the identifiers of its constituent PMOS and NMOS transistors.

### Step 1: Identify NMOS and PMOS Transistors
Identify all NMOS and PMOS transistors in the SPICE netlist. NMOS transistors typically have 'nmos' in their description, while PMOS transistors have 'pmos'.

### Step 2: Determine transistor connections
For each transistor, determine its drain, gate, and source connections.

### Step 3: Find Inverter Candidates
Look for pairs of one NMOS and one PMOS transistor where:
- The gates of both the NMOS and PMOS transistors are connected to the same node (input).
- The drains of both the NMOS and PMOS transistors are connected to the same node (output).
- The source of the NMOS transistor is connected to ground.
- The source of the PMOS transistor is connected to the supply voltage.

### Step 4: Verify Inverter Configuration
Verify that the identified pair of transistors forms a valid inverter configuration by checking if there are no other connections to the output node that would prevent it from being an inverter.

### Step 5: Identify Additional Transistors
Check for additional transistors connected to the input or output nodes of the potential inverter. If these transistors do not disrupt the basic inverter function (i.e., they are part of a more complex logic gate or buffering circuitry), include them as part of the inverter if necessary.

### Step 6: Compile List of Inverters
Compile a list of all identified inverters, including the transistor names that make up each inverter.

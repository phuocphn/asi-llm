### Step 1: Identify PMOS and NMOS Transistors
Identify all PMOS and NMOS transistors in the SPICE netlist. PMOS transistors typically have "pmos" in their description, while NMOS transistors have "nmos".

### Step 2: Determine Drain and Source Connections for Each Transistor
For each transistor identified, determine its drain and source connections.

### Step 3: Look for Complementary Transistor Pairs
Look for pairs of transistors where one is a PMOS transistor and the other is an NMOS transistor. These pairs should have their gates connected to the same node (input signal) and their drains connected to the same node (output signal).

### Step 4: Check for Power Supply Connections
Verify that the sources of the PMOS transistors are connected to the positive power supply (VDD) and the sources of the NMOS transistors are connected to the negative power supply (GND) or ground.

### Step 5: Identify Inverter Structures
An inverter structure consists of a pair of complementary transistors (one PMOS and one NMOS) that meet the conditions outlined in steps 3 and 4. The input signal is connected to the gates of both transistors, and the output is taken from the common drain connection.

### Step 6: Compile List of Inverters
Compile a list of all identified inverter structures, including the transistor names (e.g., 'm13', 'm11', 'm12') that form each inverter.

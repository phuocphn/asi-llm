### Step 1: Identify MOSFETs in the Netlist
Identify all MOSFET instances in the netlist by looking for lines that start with 'm' followed by a unique identifier, or contain "pmos" or "nmos" in their description.

### Step 2: Determine MOSFET Types and Connections
For each identified MOSFET, determine its type (PMOS or NMOS) based on its description and identify its drain, source, and gate connections.

### Step 3: Find Complementary MOSFET Pairs
Look for pairs of MOSFETs where one is a PMOS and the other is an NMOS, and they share common connections that could form an inverter circuit, such as:
- The gates of both MOSFETs are connected to the same node (input of the inverter).
- One MOSFET's source is connected to VDD (PMOS), and the other's source is connected to ground (NMOS).
- Both MOSFETs' drains are connected to the same node (output of the inverter).

### Step 4: Verify Inverter Configuration
Verify that the identified pair of transistors forms a valid inverter configuration by checking:
- The gates of both MOSFETs should be connected to the input signal.
- The drains of both MOSFETs should be connected together, forming the output node.
- The PMOS transistor has its source connected to VDD, and the NMOS transistor has its source connected to ground.
- There are no other connections to the output node that would prevent it from being an inverter.

### Step 5: Check for Additional Transistors
Check for additional transistors connected to the input or output nodes of the potential inverter. If these transistors do not disrupt the basic inverter function, include them as part of the inverter if necessary.

### Step 6: Compile List of Inverters and Identify Chains
Compile a list of all identified inverters, including the transistor names that make up each inverter. Also, look for sequences of MOSFET pairs that match the inverter configuration, where the output of one inverter is connected to the input of another, representing each inverter by the identifiers of its constituent MOSFETs.
